# Compute Lite: Your Browser-Based Computational Tool

ComputeLite is a true serverless tool designed for powerful, in-browser computation.

## 🚀 What is ComputeLite?

ComputeLite leverages the capabilities of WASM (Web Assembly) and SQLite OPFS to ensure that all data and code remain securely in the browser, with no server dependencies or external storage. This approach not only enhances privacy and security but also provides seamless edge computing for data analysis and processing, fully under the user’s control. 

### Key Features:

- Secure, serverless operations entirely in the browser.
- Advanced data analysis powered by `Python` (via Pyodide) and `SQL` (via SQLite).
- Fully user-controlled with no external dependencies.
- Future support planned for `JavaScript` and `R`.

## 🛠️ Supported Languages

Currently, ComputeLite supports the following languages:
- **Python**: Powered by Pyodide, enabling advanced scripting and analysis.
- **SQL**: Powered by SQLite, perfect for working with structured data.

### 🌟 What's Next?

We are actively working to expand ComputeLite's capabilities to include:
- **JavaScript**: Bringing native browser scripting capabilities.
- **R**: Enhancing statistical and analytical computation.
