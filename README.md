# Compute Lite: Your Browser-Based Computational Tool

ComputeLite is a true serverless tool designed for powerful, in-browser computation.

## 🚀 What is ComputeLite?

ComputeLite leverages the capabilities of WASM (Web Assembly) and SQLite OPFS to ensure that all data and code remain securely in the browser, with no server dependencies or external storage. This approach not only enhances privacy and security but also provides seamless edge computing for data analysis and processing, fully under the user’s control. 

### Key Features:

- Secure, serverless operations entirely in the browser.
- Advanced data analysis powered by `Python` (via Pyodide), `R` (viar WebR), JavaScript and `SQL` (via SQLite).
- Fully user-controlled with no external dependencies.
